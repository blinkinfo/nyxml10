            # At training time, trainer.py records the 5th and 95th percentile
            # of vol_regime across the full training dataset and stores them as
            # "regime_vol_p5" / "regime_vol_p95" in the model metadata JSON.
            #
            # Here we compare the live vol_regime value against those bounds.
            # If the live regime falls OUTSIDE [p5, p95], the model is operating
            # in a volatility environment it rarely saw during training -- its
            # probability estimates are less calibrated and the signal is suppressed.
            #
            # Design decisions:
            #   - Gate fires AFTER model.predict() so the log always contains the
            #     full p_up/p_down values. This lets you audit "what the model
            #     wanted to do" vs "what the gate blocked" -- invaluable for tuning.
            #   - If metadata is missing or the keys are absent (e.g. older model
            #     trained before this feature), the gate is silently skipped.
            #     This guarantees full backwards compatibility with no config change.
            #   - If either bound is None (degenerate training set < 10 samples),
            #     the gate is skipped -- not the live bot's fault, don't punish it.
            #   - The gate itself is wrapped in try/except so a metadata read error
            #     never crashes inference -- the model fires normally if gate errors.
